    "# Diagnostic Testing in OLS Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagnostic testing is essential to ensure that the assumptions underlying the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression are valid. Before testing statistical hypotheses, it is crucial to verify the six fundamental assumptions of the classical linear regression model. Violating these assumptions affects the reliability of coefficient estimates, standard errors, and the validity of hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions in Classical Linear Regression Model\n",
    "1. **Linearity (A1):** The relationship between independent variables and the dependent variable is linear.\n",
    "2. **Full Rank (A2):** The independent variables are not perfectly collinear.\n",
    "3. **Regression Model (A3):** The expected value of errors is zero, i.e., $ E(\\epsilon) = 0 $.\n",
    "4. **Spherical Errors (A4):** Errors have constant variance (homoscedasticity) and are not autocorrelated.\n",
    "5. **Non-Stochastic Regressors (A5):** The regressors are fixed and not random.\n",
    "6. **Normal Errors (A6):** Errors are normally distributed, $ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Violations of Assumptions\n",
    "### Types of Violations\n",
    "1. **Functional Form Violations:** \n",
    "   - Incorrect model specification (e.g., nonlinearity, omitted variables).\n",
    "   - Example: Parameter instability or omitting relevant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regressor-Related Violations:**\n",
    "   - **Multicollinearity:** Independent variables are highly correlated (violates A2).\n",
    "   - **Stochastic Regressors:** Regressors are random (violates A5).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error-Term Violations:**\n",
    "   - **Correlation with Regressors:** Errors are correlated with independent variables (violates A3).\n",
    "   - **Non-Spherical Errors:** Errors exhibit heteroskedasticity or autocorrelation (violates A4).\n",
    "   - **Non-Normal Errors:** Errors deviate from normality (violates A6).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Consequences of Violations\n",
    "1. **Wrong Coefficient Estimates:** \n",
    "   - Violation of A3 leads to biased coefficients. Example: $ E(\\epsilon) \\neq 0 $, invalidating the t-test and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Incorrect Standard Errors:** \n",
    "   - Violation of A4 affects the efficiency of OLS estimates. The variance of the coefficients becomes unreliable, invalidating inference procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inappropriate Hypothesis Testing Distribution:** \n",
    "   - Violation of A6 implies that OLS coefficients and t-tests no longer follow their assumed distributions, making hypothesis tests invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Handle Violations\n",
    "### Step 1: Detect Violations\n",
    "- Use diagnostic tests to identify violations. Example:\n",
    "  - F-tests or chi-square tests for model misspecifications.\n",
    "  - Residual analysis for detecting heteroskedasticity or autocorrelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Analyze Consequences\n",
    "- Understand how violations affect:\n",
    "  - Coefficient estimates (bias).\n",
    "  - Standard errors (inefficiency).\n",
    "  - Distribution assumptions (invalid hypothesis tests).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Address Violations\n",
    "1. **Eliminate the Violation:**\n",
    "   - Correct model specification (e.g., include omitted variables).\n",
    "   - Transform data to meet assumptions (e.g., log transformations).\n",
    "2. **Use Alternative Techniques:**\n",
    "   - **Instrumental Variable Estimation:** Address correlation between errors and regressors.\n",
    "   - **Generalized Least Squares (GLS):** Correct for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diagnostic Testing Procedure\n",
    "Diagnostic testing resembles hypothesis testing but focuses on detecting violations in model assumptions. This involves:\n",
    "1. Computing a test statistic based on residuals or model performance.\n",
    "2. Comparing the test statistic to a theoretical distribution (e.g., F-distribution or chi-square).\n",
    "3. Making adjustments if violations are detected to ensure the stability and credibility of the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Diagnostic testing is a vital step in econometrics to ensure the robustness of OLS regression models. By systematically identifying and addressing violations, researchers can build credible models for reliable statistical inference and decision-making.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Key Assumptions and Their Violations\n",
    "In regression models, the assumptions ensure the model's validity. Violating these assumptions can lead to biased, inefficient, or inconsistent results. Below, we discuss three main types of violations:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Omitted Variables\n",
    "- **Definition**: When a relevant variable is excluded from the model, its effect is absorbed into the error term, causing correlation between the error term and regressors.\n",
    "- **Example**: Estimating a consumption function without including wealth as a variable.\n",
    "- **Effect**: The coefficient estimates become biased, as the omitted variable's effect is incorrectly attributed to included regressors.\n",
    "- **Correction**: Include the missing variable if possible or use **Instrumental Variables (IV)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Simultaneity\n",
    "- **Definition**: When a regressor is endogenous (dependent on the dependent variable), there is a bidirectional relationship between the dependent and independent variables.\n",
    "- **Example**: Consumption function where consumption ($C_t$) depends on income ($Y_t$), and income depends on consumption.\n",
    "- **Effect**: Correlation between regressors and error terms leads to biased and inconsistent OLS estimates.\n",
    "- **Correction**: Use **Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)** or **IV** estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Measurement Error\n",
    "- **Definition**: Occurs when variables are measured with error, causing misrepresentation in the model.\n",
    "- **Example**: Using a proxy ($Z$) instead of the true value of a variable ($X$).\n",
    "- **Effect**: Leads to biased, inefficient, and inconsistent estimates.\n",
    "- **Correction**: Use **Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)**, **2SLS**, or robust instruments.\n",

    "1. **Biased Coefficients**:\n",
    "   - Occurs when regressors are correlated with errors (e.g., omitted variables, simultaneity).\n",
    "   - Leads to incorrect inferences.\n",
    "2. **Inefficient Estimators**:\n",
    "   - Violations like heteroskedasticity affect standard errors, making estimators inefficient.\n",
    "3. **Invalid Hypothesis Testing**:\n",
    "   - Non-normal errors or correlated regressors lead to invalid test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solutions to Violations\n",
    "1. **Omitted Variables**:\n",

    "   - Use IV for unbiased estimation.\n",
    "2. **Simultaneity**:\n",
    "   - Employ 2SLS or GMM estimators.\n",
    "3. **Measurement Error**:\n",
    "   - Use robust instruments or external variables as proxies.\n",
    "4. **General Approach**:\n",

    "- **Steps:**\n",
    "  1. **Estimate the original regression model** and compute residuals.\n",
    "  2. **Auxiliary regression:** Regress residuals on original regressors plus lagged residuals ($ \\hat{\\epsilon}_{t-1}, \\hat{\\epsilon}_{t-2}, \\ldots, \\hat{\\epsilon}_{t-r} $).\n",
    "  3. **Null Hypothesis ($ H_0 $):** $ \\rho_1 = \\rho_2 = \\ldots = \\rho_r = 0 $ (no autocorrelation).\n",
    "  4. Calculate test statistic:\n",
    "     - $ BG = (T - r) R^2 \\sim \\chi^2_r $, where $ r $ is the number of lags.\n",

    "- Autocorrelation in residuals often arises when important dynamics (e.g., seasonality or lags) are not modeled.\n",
    "- It makes OLS estimates inefficient, biased, and unreliable for statistical inference.\n",
    "- Use **Durbin-Watson** for first-order tests and **Breusch-Godfrey** for higher-order autocorrelation.\n"

    "## **What Are Stochastic Regressors?**\n",
    "- **Non-Stochastic Regressors:** Assumes regressors ($ X $) are fixed and do not change if we change the sample.\n",
    "  - True in experimental data where regressors are under our control.\n",
    "- **Stochastic Regressors:** When $ X $ is randomly drawn from a probability distribution, it changes as the sample changes.\n",
    "  - Common in economics and finance where both $ X $ and $ Y $ are stochastic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Analyzing OLS with Stochastic Regressors**\n",
    "To understand the properties of the OLS estimator ($ \\hat{\\beta} $):\n",
    "1. **Conditional Analysis:** Analyze $ \\hat{\\beta} $ given $ X $ (like in the non-stochastic case).\n",
    "2. **Expectation Over Distribution:** Average results over the distribution of $ X $.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Consequences of Stochastic Regressors**\n",
    "- Even with stochastic regressors, $ \\hat{\\beta} $ remains **unbiased** for $ \\beta $.\n",
    "- Variance of $ \\hat{\\beta} $ is **different** because it depends on the expectation of $ (X'X)^{-1} $:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\sigma^2 E\\left[(X'X)^{-1}\\right]\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  - Unlike non-stochastic regressors, where variance is a fixed number, here it is an expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Results**\n",
    "- If assumptions $ A1 $ (linearity), $ A2 $ (full rank), $ A3 $ (correct model), and $ A4 $ (spherical errors) hold, but **$ A5 $ (non-stochastic regressors)** does not:\n",

    "  - The **Gauss-Markov theorem** still holds: $ \\hat{\\beta} $ is the **linear unbiased estimator with minimum variance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Practical Implications**\n",
    "- With stochastic regressors, the variance is estimated as an expected value instead of a fixed number.\n",
    "- The OLS properties still hold, making $ \\hat{\\beta} $ the best available estimator for $ \\beta $.\n",
    "- Retaining the assumption of non-stochastic regressors simplifies presentations and interpretations but is often unrealistic in real-world applications.\n",

    "$$\n",

    "- **Number of Observations:** 225\n",
    "- **R-squared:** 0.328\n",
    "  - About 32.8% of the variability in `lnffr` is explained by `inflation` and `bus_cycle`.\n",
    "- **Adjusted R-squared:** 0.322\n",
    "  - Adjusted for the number of predictors; slightly lower than R-squared.\n",
    "\n",

    "| Inflation  | 0.3193      | 0.034      | 9.517   | 0.000   | [0.253, 0.385]          |\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Interpretation of Coefficients:**\n",
    "1. **Inflation:** A unit increase in inflation is associated with a 0.3193 unit increase in `lnffr`, holding all else constant. This relationship is highly significant ($ p < 0.001 $).\n",
    "2. **Bus Cycle:** A unit increase in `bus_cycle` is associated with a 0.1564 unit increase in `lnffr`. This relationship is also statistically significant ($ p = 0.007 $).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Fit**\n",
    "- **F-statistic:** 54.19 ($ p < 0.001 $)\n",
    "  - Indicates the model is statistically significant overall.\n",
    "- **AIC (771.8) and BIC (782.1):**\n",
    "  - Metrics to compare model fit, lower values indicate better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Residual Diagnostics**\n",
    "- **Durbin-Watson Statistic:** 0.108\n",
    "  - Indicates strong **positive autocorrelation** in residuals, which violates the OLS assumption of no autocorrelation.\n",
    "- **Omnibus and Jarque-Bera Tests:**\n",
    "  - Both tests reject the null hypothesis of normally distributed residuals ($ p < 0.001 $).\n",
    "  - The residuals exhibit skewness (-1.057) and non-normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Residual Analysis with ACF and PACF**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Autocorrelation (ACF) Plot**\n",
    "- The ACF plot shows a gradual decline in autocorrelation values over lags, indicating significant **positive autocorrelation** in residuals.\n",
    "- Residual autocorrelations are outside the 95% confidence bounds for several lags.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) Plot**\n",
    "- The PACF plot shows a significant spike at lag 1, confirming **first-order autocorrelation** in residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Issues Identified**\n",
    "1. **Autocorrelation in Residuals:**\n",
    "   - The Durbin-Watson statistic (0.108) and ACF/PACF plots confirm significant positive autocorrelation.\n",
    "   - Positive autocorrelation violates the OLS assumption of independent residuals, leading to:\n",
    "     - Biased standard errors.\n",
    "     - Inflated $ R^2 $ values.\n",
    "     - Increased likelihood of Type I errors (false positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-Normality of Residuals:**\n",
    "   - Omnibus and Jarque-Bera tests indicate residuals are not normally distributed, which affects inference validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Next Steps to Address Issues**\n",
    "1. **Autocorrelation:**\n",
    "   - Use a Generalized Least Squares (GLS) model or Cochrane-Orcutt method to correct for autocorrelation.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, include lagged dependent variables to capture dynamics in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-Normality:**\n",
    "   - Consider transforming the dependent variable (e.g., log transformation) or using robust regression techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reassess Model:**\n",
    "   - Investigate if additional explanatory variables or lagged terms can improve the model fit and address residual issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these issues, the model's reliability and inference validity can be significantly improved.\n"

    "# Normality Assumption in OLS\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What Is the Normality Assumption?**\n",
    "- The assumption of **normality** states that the error term ($ \\epsilon $) in a regression model is normally distributed.\n",
    "- Normality is **not required** for the OLS estimator to be BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator).\n",
    "- However, it is important for:\n",
    "  - **Hypothesis Testing**: The $ t $-test assumes a normal distribution for the numerator.\n",
    "  - Simplifying algebra: A normal distribution is fully characterized by its mean and variance, making calculations straightforward.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why Check for Normality?**\n",
    "- Departure from normality impacts:\n",
    "  - The **distribution of test statistics** (e.g., $ t $-tests may not follow the $ t $-distribution).\n",
    "  - The **inference procedure** (e.g., p-values become unreliable).\n",

    "# When to Use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a foundational statistical method for estimating the relationships between variables. However, its applicability depends on the nature of the data and the research question. Below are the scenarios where OLS is appropriate:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Continuous Dependent Variable**\n",
    "   - OLS is most suitable when the dependent variable is continuous and unbounded (e.g., income, weight, temperature).\n",
    "   - Example: Estimating the relationship between hours studied and exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Linear Relationship**\n",
    "   - The relationship between the dependent variable (`y`) and the independent variables (`x`) should be linear.\n",
    "   - Example: The impact of advertising expenditure on sales, where sales increase linearly with more advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **No Multicollinearity**\n",
    "   - OLS assumes that the independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "   - High multicollinearity can distort coefficient estimates and their statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Homoscedasticity**\n",
    "   - The variance of the error term should be constant across all levels of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "   - If this assumption is violated (heteroscedasticity), robust standard errors or alternative estimators should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **No Autocorrelation**\n",
    "   - The error terms should not be correlated across observations.\n",
    "   - This is particularly important in time-series data where autocorrelation can bias OLS results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Large Sample Size**\n",
    "   - OLS performs well with large datasets because it minimizes the variance of estimators under the Gauss-Markov theorem.\n",
    "   - Small samples may lead to unreliable results, particularly if other assumptions are borderline valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. **Dependent Variable's Range**\n",
    "   - The dependent variable should not have bounded or binary values.\n",
    "   - For binary dependent variables (e.g., yes/no decisions), models like logit or probit are preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When Not to Use OLS\n",
    "- **Binary or Categorical Dependent Variables**:\n",
    "  - For binary outcomes (e.g., voting: yes/no), use logit or probit models instead of OLS.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Panel Data**:\n",
    "  - When lagged dependent variables are included, OLS can be biased and inconsistent. Use Generalized Method of Moments (GMM).\n",
    "- **Violation of Assumptions**:\n",
    "  - When any of the key OLS assumptions (e.g., linearity, no heteroscedasticity) are significantly violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Summary\n",
    "Use OLS when:\n",
    "1. The dependent variable is continuous and unbounded.\n",
    "2. The relationship between variables is linear.\n",
    "3. The assumptions of homoscedasticity, no multicollinearity, and no autocorrelation are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-linear relationships, bounded outcomes, or violations of assumptions, alternative estimation techniques should be considered.\n"

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Disney Model:**\n",
    "   - Disney has a significant intercept, indicating the potential for excess returns beyond market performance.\n",
    "   - The beta suggests Disney's returns are slightly more volatile than the market.\n",
    "   - The model does not suffer from heteroskedasticity or autocorrelation, but residuals are not normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GE Model:**\n",
    "   - GE's intercept is not significant, meaning returns are closely aligned with market performance.\n",
    "   - The beta shows similar volatility to Disney.\n",
    "   - The model exhibits heteroskedasticity and positive autocorrelation, which require further adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Diagnostic Insights:**\n",
    "   - Both models have issues with non-normal residuals, which could be addressed by transforming the dependent variable or using robust standard errors.\n",
    "   - The GE model’s heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation issues may require a generalized least squares (GLS) approach or ARIMA modeling for the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while both models effectively capture market sensitivity, the diagnostic results suggest the need for refinements, particularly in the GE model, to ensure valid inference and robust results.\n"
